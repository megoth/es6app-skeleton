<h1>Planning the index component</h1><p>The index component will be very similar to the navigation component, so we don&#39;t need much planning. But there are some differences important to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep track of the active slide.</li>
<li>The index is a list of slides, which should be expressed with two components: One for the list itself, and another for the list items.</li>
</ul>
<p>The directive itself is very similar to the navigation directive; It ties all our modules together, and it needs to re-render upon state-change.</p>
