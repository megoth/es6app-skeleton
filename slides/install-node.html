<h1>Installing Node.js and NPM</h1><p>We&#39;re going to use Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) to handle a lot of the dependencies for the developer side of the application. So download the Node platform from <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and install it to your OS. This makes the <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> commands globally available in your terminal (you may have to open a new terminal window).</p>
<p>If you are unable to uninstall Node, check out <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager</a>.</p>
