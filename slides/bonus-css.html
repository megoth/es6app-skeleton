<h1>Bonus - Generating the CSS</h1><p>The CSS is written using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, which is a preprocessor for CSS. In addition a lot of mixins from <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> have been used fix some standard problems.</p>
<p>The rules are in <code>sass/style.sass</code> and have been written with a <a href="http://zurb.com/word/mobile-first">mobile first approach</a> in mind; that is, the design is written for small screens first, and then adjusted to larger screens.</p>
<p>The CSS-file is generated with <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass">grunt-contrib-compass</a>, whose task is located in <code>grunt/compass.js</code> (which is referred to in <code>grunt/aliases.js</code>).</p>
