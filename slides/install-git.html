<h1>Installing Git</h1><p>We&#39;ll use a clone of a skeleton of this application as base for the application. For this we need <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed.</p>
<p>Install Git by finding the appropriate release <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. This will install <code>git</code> as a command in your terminal.</p>
<p>(If you prefer more graphical clients, you can instead try <a href="https://windows.github.com/">windows.github.com</a> or <a href="https://mac.github.com/">mac.github.com</a>.)</p>
