We'll use a clone of a skeleton of this application as base for the application. For this we need [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed.

Install Git by finding the appropriate release [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). This will install ```git``` as a command in your terminal.

(If you prefer more graphical clients, you can instead try [windows.github.com](https://windows.github.com/) or [mac.github.com](https://mac.github.com/).)
