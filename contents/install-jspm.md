[jspm](http://jspm.io/) is a package manager for JavaScript packages. It handles multiple types of module formats from multiple registries (such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Bower](http://bower.io/)).

Install it with NPM:

    npm install -g jspm

This makes it globally available in your terminal.
