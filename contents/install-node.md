We're going to use Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) to handle a lot of the dependencies for the developer side of the application. So download the Node platform from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and install it to your OS. This makes the ```node``` and ```npm``` commands globally available in your terminal (you may have to open a new terminal window).

If you are unable to uninstall Node, check out [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
