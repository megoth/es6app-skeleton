This concludes our presentation. We should now have a working application that drives this presentation.

As part of this workshop we've:

* Installed developer tools that enable us to set up applications like this one
* Made use of Grunt to automate tasks, such as running a simple HTTP server
* Made use of jspm and written code using ES6-syntax
    * Learned a bit about some very handy functions used with JS arrays and functions
* Installed and implemented an application using an array of frameworks
    * Configured and implemented Angular services, factories, and directives
    * Implemented a bunch of React components
    * Implemented realtime communication with server using Socket.IO

I hope you enjoyed the presentation!
